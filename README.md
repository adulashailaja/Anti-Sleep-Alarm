# Anti-Sleep-Alarm
An Arduino-based embedded system designed to demonstrate practical automation and control concepts. It includes a complete Arduino sketch  and a detailed explanation document describing the circuit design, working principle, and implementation steps. The project integrates sensors, actuators, and control logic.
# Arduino Final Project

## Overview
This repository contains an Arduino project demonstrating [briefly describe the purpose — e.g., "a temperature-controlled fan," "an obstacle-avoiding robot," or "a home automation system"].  
It includes the complete Arduino sketch and documentation explaining the project design and functionality.

## Files
- **final_project.ino** — Main Arduino code for the project.
- **explanation.pdf** — Documentation explaining the circuit, components, and code.

## Requirements
- Arduino IDE
- Required Libraries (if any)
- Supported Board: [e.g., Arduino Uno, Mega, etc.]

## Usage
1. Open `final_project.ino` in Arduino IDE.
2. Connect your board and upload the code.
3. Follow the setup instructions in `explanation.pdf`.

## License
This project is open-source and available for educational and personal use.

Would you like me to open the `.ino` file and generate a **customized description** (with actual functionality details) instead of a generic one? That would make your GitHub README more meaningful. ​:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}​
